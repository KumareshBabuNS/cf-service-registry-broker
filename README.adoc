= Cloud Foundry Service Registry Broker
Matt Stine <mstine@pivotal.io>

_This is an experimental project not suitable for production use!_

This repository contains two projects:

+service-registry-broker+:: A service broker which acts as a _service registry_ for web services applications deployed to an instance of Cloud Foundry.
+service-registry-client+ (WIP - not pushed yet):: A Java client library extension to http://projects.spring.io/spring-cloud[Spring Cloud] which will automatically register Spring applications in the registry once bound to an instance of the Service Registry service.

== Usage

=== Build and Deploy Service Registry Broker

_This application currently depends on a version of https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-java-client that has not yet been released to Maven Central. Until this message has been removed, you will need to clone, build, and locally install that library._

. After cloning, build the application:
+
[source,text]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble
----

. Create an instance of a MySQL service. Assuming you're running on Pivotal CF:
+
[source,text]
----
$ cf cs p-mysql 100mb-dev cf-srb-db
Creating service cf-srb-db in org mstine-org / space development as admin...
OK
----

. Create a +manifest.yml+ file at the root of the repository with the following contents. Substitute all occurrences of +<token>+ with proper values for your Cloud Foundry environment:

$ cf push

. Once the application starts, you should see it in the services marketplace:

=== Using the Service Registry

Creating an instance of this service and binding it to your application will inject the URL and credentials for the service registry API into +VCAP_SERVICES+:

[source,text]
----
VCAP_SERVICES={"service-registry":[{"name":"my-service-registry","label":"service-registry","tags":[],"plan":"Standard","credentials":{"uri":"http://cf-service-registry-broker.cf.deepsouthcloud.com/registry","username":"warreng","password":"natedogg"}}]}
----

The registry currently supports two operations, _register_ and _unregister_. Here are some examples illustrated via curl:

.Register
[source,text]
----
$ curl -i -u warreng:natedogg http://cf-service-registry-broker.cf.deepsouthcloud.com/registry -X POST \
-d '{"name":"a-web-service","description":"A wicked cool web service!","longDescription":"A wicked cool web service that will provide you with unicorns and rainbows.","displayName":"A Web Service","provider":"My Awesome Startup","features":["Feature 1","Feature 2","Feature 3"],"url":"http://my.url.com","basicAuthUser":"tupac","basicAuthPassword":"makaveli"}' \
